# React Portfolio
This portfolio will be used to show off some of what I have done so far in the course that I believe is worth putting together on here
## Tools
This portfolio was made using React, Tailwind, and Typescript
## Description
This is just a simple proof of concept for what I want my portfolio to look like and it was used as some practice into tools like tailwind and typescript as well as being a mock-up for my final portfolio
